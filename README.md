# Diabetes-GLM-GAM

Project examines optimal binomial link functions & creates models to predict diabetes.
Though the project was done for ST662, as graduate students we were required to (A) teach the methodology/topics within a given chapter and (B) find our own dataset to analyze using the info learned from said chapter

Code is unpolished/optimized.
